#Instruction how to execute Low-tides

= Introduction =

Low-tides is an automation of YSlow recommendation #1 (Reduce Http Request) and #10 (Minimize JS/CSS). The tool accepts html path and extracts js/css includes for merging and minification. 

Some of the reasons why we developed this tool are as follows:

# Improve page loads by reducing http request and minimizing js size. 
# Perform step #1 with minimal action for the developer and yet maintain proper version.

Low-tides processes html files and looks for js and css includes. It then combines multiple js in sequence into 1 js file and perform minification. Based on our own test, load time has improved by at least 30% after using low-tides.
 
This tool is an extension of YUI Compressor.
